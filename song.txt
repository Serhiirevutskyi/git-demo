I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus:]

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you baby
